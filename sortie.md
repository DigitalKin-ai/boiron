**Enhanced Summary of Study Conclusions:**
The study robustly suggests that homeopathic Crataegus 6 cH (produced in a 6 centesimal dilution) is an efficacious therapeutic approach for dogs suffering from early-stage myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The study provides compelling evidence that treatment with Crataegus 6 cH led to statistically significant improvements in systolic blood pressure reduction more rapidly than Crataegus MT (mother tincture). Furthermore, important cardiac function indicators such as fractional shortening (FS) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) were also notably improved with the homeopathic regimen, with no reported adverse side effects. The therapeutic effects of Crataegus were systematically verified using comprehensive statistical analysis, adding credibility to the conclusions drawn. Overall, the study robustly endorses the inclusion of homeopathic Crataegus as a valuable treatment option to prolong the asymptomatic stage in canine patients afflicted by MMVD, offering beneficial outcomes in managing heart failure symptoms without incurring any adverse health impacts.
